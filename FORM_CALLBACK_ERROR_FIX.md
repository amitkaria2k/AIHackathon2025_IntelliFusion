# Streamlit Form Callback Error Fix

## Issue Fixed: StreamlitInvalidFormCallbackError

**Error Message:** 
```
StreamlitInvalidFormCallbackError: Within a form, callbacks can only be defined on 
`st.form_submit_button`. Defining callbacks on other widgets inside a form is not allowed.
```

## Root Cause Analysis:

The error occurred because I attempted to use widget callbacks and session state updates on widgets (checkboxes, radio buttons, file uploaders) that were inside a Streamlit form (`st.form`). Streamlit has a strict rule that callbacks can only be defined on `st.form_submit_button` within forms.

**Problematic Code Structure:**
```python
with st.form("new_project_form"):
    # ... form content ...
    
    # This was causing the error - callbacks inside form
    include_doc = st.checkbox(
        f"üìÑ {doc_type}",
        value=current_state.get('include', False),
        key=f"include_{doc_type}",
        on_change=update_session_state  # ‚ùå Not allowed inside forms
    )
    
    template_source = st.radio(
        f"Template source for {doc_type}:",
        ["AI Generated", "Upload Template"],
        on_change=update_session_state  # ‚ùå Not allowed inside forms
    )
```

## Solution Implemented:

### 1. **Form Restructuring** ‚úÖ

**Moved Document Type Selection Outside Form:**
- Extracted all document type selection widgets from inside the form
- Placed document type selection in a separate section before the form
- Only basic project information remains inside the form

**New Structure:**
```python
# Outside form - Interactive widgets with session state
st.subheader("üìã Document Types & Template Sources")
# ... document type selection widgets with session state updates ...

# Inside form - Basic project information only
with st.form("new_project_form"):
    # Basic project details (name, type, description, requirements)
    # ... no callbacks or complex session state updates ...
    submitted = st.form_submit_button("‚úÖ Create Project", type="primary")
```

### 2. **Session State Management** ‚úÖ

**Maintained State Persistence:**
- Document selections still persist across page refreshes
- Session state updates happen outside the form context
- Form submission reads from session state for document selections

```python
# Session state updates outside form
st.session_state.new_project_doc_selections[doc_type]['include'] = include_doc
st.session_state.new_project_doc_selections[doc_type]['source'] = template_source

# Form submission reads from session state
if submitted:
    recommended_docs = list(st.session_state.doc_template_selections.keys())
```

### 3. **Enhanced User Experience** ‚úÖ

**Added Summary Section:**
- Shows document selection summary before form submission
- Users can see their choices before creating the project
- Clear feedback on selected document types and template sources

**Interactive Flow:**
1. **Upload Templates** (if needed) ‚Üí No form reset
2. **Select Document Types** ‚Üí Immediate feedback, persistent state
3. **Choose Template Sources** ‚Üí AI Generated or Upload Template
4. **Fill Project Details** ‚Üí Traditional form for basic information
5. **Submit Project** ‚Üí Processes all selections together

### 4. **Error Resolution** ‚úÖ

**Eliminated Form Callback Conflicts:**
- No callbacks on widgets inside forms
- Session state updates happen in appropriate contexts
- Streamlit form rules fully complied with

## Technical Details:

### Form Compliance:
- **Inside Form:** Only basic input widgets without callbacks
- **Outside Form:** Interactive widgets with session state management
- **Form Submit:** Processes all data from both form and session state

### State Management:
- **Document Selections:** Managed via `st.session_state.new_project_doc_selections`
- **Template Choices:** Stored in `st.session_state.doc_template_selections`
- **Form Persistence:** Template uploads don't reset document selections
- **Cleanup:** Session state cleared after successful project creation

### User Flow Improvements:
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Users build their selections step by step
- **Visual Feedback:** Summary shows selections before submission
- **Error Prevention:** No form callback errors, smooth user experience
- **State Persistence:** Selections maintained throughout the process

## Files Modified:

**`app_enhanced.py`** - `show_new_project()` function:
- Moved document type selection outside the form
- Removed duplicate code from inside the form
- Added document selection summary section
- Maintained session state management for persistence
- Fixed form structure to comply with Streamlit rules

## Testing Results: ‚úÖ SUCCESS

**Before Fix:**
- ‚ùå Application crashed with StreamlitInvalidFormCallbackError
- ‚ùå Users couldn't create new projects
- ‚ùå Form callback conflicts prevented app from running

**After Fix:**
- ‚úÖ Application runs without errors
- ‚úÖ Document type selection works smoothly
- ‚úÖ Template uploads don't reset selections
- ‚úÖ Form submission processes all data correctly
- ‚úÖ Session state persistence maintained

## Current Status:

‚úÖ **Application Running:** http://127.0.0.1:8503  
‚úÖ **Error Fixed:** No form callback errors  
‚úÖ **Functionality Restored:** New project creation works perfectly  
‚úÖ **User Experience Enhanced:** Better workflow with summary feedback  

The application now fully complies with Streamlit's form callback rules while maintaining all the enhanced functionality for document type selection and template management!
