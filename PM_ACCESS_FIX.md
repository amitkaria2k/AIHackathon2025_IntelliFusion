# PM Access Fix - New Project and Edit Projects Tabs

## Issue
When "PM" users logged in, they could not see the "New Project" and "Edit Projects" tabs, even though PMs should have full access to all features.

## Root Cause
In the tab creation logic for PM users (line 1079), there was an incorrect line that was setting tab2 and tab3 to None:

```python
# INCORRECT CODE (REMOVED):
tab2 = tab3 = tab10 = None
```

This was overriding the proper tab assignments that were made in the previous line:
```python
tab1, tab2, tab3, tab4, tab5, tab6, tab7, tab8 = st.tabs([...])
```

## Solution Applied
**File**: `app_enhanced.py`
**Lines**: 1068-1080

**Before:**
```python
if user_role == 'PM':
    # PM has access to all tabs
    tab1, tab2, tab3, tab4, tab5, tab6, tab7, tab8 = st.tabs([
        "🏠 Dashboard", 
        "🆕 New Project", 
        "✏️ Edit Projects",
        "📝 Generate Document", 
        "👥 Workflow Management", 
        "📊 Project Overview",
        "💬 AI Assistant",
        "⚙️ Settings"
    ])
    # Create placeholder tabs to maintain structure
    tab2 = tab3 = tab10 = None  # ❌ THIS WAS THE PROBLEM
```

**After:**
```python
if user_role == 'PM':
    # PM has access to all tabs
    tab1, tab2, tab3, tab4, tab5, tab6, tab7, tab8 = st.tabs([
        "🏠 Dashboard", 
        "🆕 New Project", 
        "✏️ Edit Projects",
        "📝 Generate Document", 
        "👥 Workflow Management", 
        "📊 Project Overview",
        "💬 AI Assistant",
        "⚙️ Settings"
    ])
    # PM has full access - no tabs set to None
    tab10 = None  # Only tab10 is not used by PM ✅ FIXED
```

## Result
- PM users now have full access to:
  - ✅ **🆕 New Project** tab (tab2)
  - ✅ **✏️ Edit Projects** tab (tab3)
  - ✅ All other tabs as intended

## Access Control Summary
- **PM**: Full access to all 8 tabs (Dashboard, New Project, Edit Projects, Generate Document, Workflow Management, Project Overview, AI Assistant, Settings)
- **Project team**: Limited access to 6 tabs (no New Project or Edit Projects)
- **Quality team**: Audit-focused access to 5 tabs (no document generation or project creation)

## Testing
- Login with PM role (password: "admin")
- Verify that "New Project" and "Edit Projects" tabs are now visible
- App running at: http://127.0.0.1:8503
