# üèÜ IntelliFusion AI Document Assistant - Technical Solution Overview
## One-Minute Championship Pitch Transcript

---

**[0:00-0:15] Problem & Innovation Hook**

"We've revolutionized Bosch's document management with **IntelliFusion** - an enterprise-grade AI system that transforms static documents into intelligent, self-organizing knowledge. While others create simple chatbots, we've built a comprehensive **Document Intelligence Service** that thinks, learns, and optimizes your entire document lifecycle."

---

**[0:15-0:30] Core AI Architecture**

"Our solution leverages **three breakthrough AI technologies**: First, we've integrated Bosch's own **LLM Farm using GPT-4o-mini** for enterprise-grade natural language processing. Second, we've implemented **advanced RAG architecture** for semantic document retrieval and context-aware responses. Third, our **proprietary Document Intelligence Service** performs 7-layer analysis - from document classification to compliance checking to workflow optimization."
